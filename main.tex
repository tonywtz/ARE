\begin{abstract}
This article reviews the literature on currency risk with a focus on its macroeconomic origins and implications. A growing body of evidence shows that countries with safer currencies enjoy persistently lower interest rates, a lower required return to capital, and accumulate relatively more capital than countries international investors perceive as risky. While earlier research has focused mainly on the role of currency risk in generating violations of uncovered interest parity and other financial anomalies, more recent evidence also points to important implications for the allocation of capital across countries, the efficacy of exchange rate stabilization policies, the sustainability of trade deficits, and the spill-over of shocks across borders.

\section{Introduction}


A key tenet in economics is that the degree to which firms should be willing to invest in a given project depends crucially on the required rate of return to capital: a price-taking firm should install just enough capital so that the marginal product of capital, $MPK_i$ equals the required rate of return to capital,$r_i$, \begin{equation}MPK_i=\underbrace{r^f+RP_i}_{ r_i}.\label{eq_one}\end{equation} 
This equation is the point of departure for many classic questions in economics. Students of asset pricing are taught that a firm's $r_i$ has two components; a risk-free part, $r^f$, and a risk-premium, $RP_i$, that depends on the firm's risk characteristics. One of the classic puzzles in asset pricing is why $RP_i$ is so large relative to $r^f$ (the equity premium puzzle). Monetary economists are interested in the Federal Reserve's power to manipulate $r^f$, while students of economic growth often take differences in the $MPK_i$ as a measure of inefficiencies in the allocation of capital across countries.

In this article we argue that recent insights from the study of currency risk premia have important lessons for how we should think about equation (\ref{eq_one}), and by extension, for its key applications in asset pricing, macroeconomics, and economic growth. The simplest, and perhaps and most important, of these lessons is that countries differ dramatically in their risk-free interest rates. These differences in risk-free interest rates are large (on the same order of magnitude as the equity premium puzzle), appear to be highly persistent over time (lasting for decades rather than years), and cannot be explained by predictable depreciations, government default, or differences in inflation rates. Instead, these differences in interest rates appear intimately linked to the risk characteristics of the country's exchange rate, and to its exchange rate regime.   

Figure XX shows this fact using the New Zealand Dollar and the Japanese Yen as an example. It plots the difference in the two currencies' risk-free interest rates over time (we will discuss below how one can measure such risk-free rates and compare them across countries). The Figure shows that between 19XX and 20XX, the New Zealand always had a higher risk-free rate than Japan, on average this difference was about 6pp. When we adjust for movements in exchange rates over the period, the difference in returns on the two countries currencies is XXpp, and XXpp when we adjust for differential inflation. Over the same time period, the equity premium on US stocks was about XXpp.

think its risk

appears to have real effect. For example K/Y in New Zealand is XX percent lower than in Japan.

\section{Interest Rate Differentials are Differences in Risk Premia}
\subsection{Theory}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Bare-bones model, no differences in r when risk-neutral
    \item Get differences in r when risk averse
    \item Pretty much any asymmetry you put into a standad macro model will produce differences in r
\end{enumerate}

Some statement of K/Y Lucas puzzle using this Hall and Jorgensen equation
Basic facts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item K/Y differences strongly correlated with differences in interest rates.
    \item Are differences in interest rates to blame for K/Y puzzle?
    \item Finance people have been working on this problem and calling it the carry trade.
    \item Interest rate differentials are large and persistent  Hassan and Mano (2019)
\end{enumerate}
In this paper, we summarize the parts of this finance research that is directly important for the K/Y puzzle.
