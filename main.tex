\begin{abstract}
  This article reviews the literature on currency risk with a focus on
  its macroeconomic origins and implications. A growing body of
  evidence shows that countries with safer currencies enjoy
  persistently lower interest rates, a lower required return to
  capital, and accumulate relatively more capital than countries
  international investors perceive as risky. While earlier research
  has focused mainly on the role of currency risk in generating
  violations of uncovered interest parity and other financial
  anomalies, more recent evidence also points to important
  implications for the allocation of capital across countries, the
  efficacy of exchange rate stabilization policies, the sustainability
  of trade deficits, and the spill-over of shocks across borders.

\section{Introduction}


A key tenet in economics is that the degree to which firms should be
willing to invest in a given project depends crucially on the required
rate of return to capital: a price-taking firm should install just
enough capital so that the marginal product of capital, $MPK_i$ equals
the required rate of return to
capital,$r_i$, \begin{equation}MPK_i=\underbrace{r^f+RP_i}_{
    r_i}.\label{eq_one}\end{equation} This equation is the point of
departure for many classic questions in economics. Students of asset
pricing are taught that a firm's $r_i$ has two components; a risk-free
part, $r^f$, and a risk-premium, $RP_i$, that depends on the firm's
risk characteristics. One of the classic puzzles in asset pricing is
why $RP_i$ is so large relative to $r^f$ (the equity premium puzzle).
Monetary economists are interested in the Federal Reserve's power to
manipulate $r^f$, while students of economic growth often take
differences in the $MPK_i$ as a measure of inefficiencies in the
allocation of capital across countries.

In this article we will argue that recent insights from the study of
currency risk premia have important lessons for how we should think
about equation (\ref{eq_one}), and by extension, for its key
applications in asset pricing, macroeconomics, and economic growth.
The simplest, and perhaps and most important, of these lessons is that
countries differ dramatically in their risk-free interest rates. These
differences in risk-free interest rates are large (on the same order
of magnitude as the equity premium puzzle), appear to be highly
persistent over time (lasting for decades rather than years), and
cannot be explained by predictable depreciations, government default,
or differences in inflation rates. Instead, these differences in
interest rates appear intimately linked to the risk characteristics of
the country's exchange rate, and by extension, to its exchange rate
regime.



\section{Interest rates and risk premia}

\subsection{Theory}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Bare-bones model, no differences in r when risk-neutral
\item Get differences in r when risk averse
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Evidence that currency returns depend on risk}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[-] Some currencies are safer than others
\item SIMPLE PICTURE
\item Campbell, Meideiros and Viceira (2010)
\item[-] Risk factors: People in finance have shown this formally
\item Lustig and Verdelhan (2007)
\item Brunnermeier, Nagel and Pedersen (2008)
\item Lustig, Roussanov and Verdelhan (2011)
\item Burnside, Eichenbaum, Kleshchelski and Rebelo (2011)
\item Menkhoff, Sarno, Schmeling, and Schrimpf (2012)
\item Lustig, Roussanov and Verdelhan (2014)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Microfoundations}
These differences in risk premia arise naturally in macro models.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hassan (2013)
\item Gabaix and Maggiori (2015)
\item Farhi and Gabaix (2016)
\item Ready Roussanov Ward (2017)

\item Della Corte, Riddiough and Sarno (2016)
\item Tran (2013)
\item Powers (2015)
\item Wiriadinata (2020)
\end{enumerate}

\item Gourio, Siemer and Verdelhan (2013)
\item Colacito, Croce, Ho and Howard (2018)
\end{enumerate}


\section{Implications for Macro Puzzles}
If there is indeed something to this story, it changes how we think
about central issues in macro.

\subsection{Allocation of capital across countries}
There are large differences in capital accumulation across countries:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Lucas (1988)
\item Caselli and Feyrer (2007)
\item Monge-Naranjo, Sanchez and Santaeualia-Llopis (2018)
\end{enumerate}
These differences may be explained by risk premia:
\begin{enumerate}
\item di Giovanni, Kalemli-Ozcan, Ulu, Baskaya (2019)
\item Richers (2020)
\item Hassan, Mertens and Zhang (2016)
\item David, Henriksen and Simanovska
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Capital flows and the allocation puzzle}
Capital flows run counter to neo-classical model:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Gourinchas and Jeanne (2013)
\item[-] Current explanations:
\item Differences in financial development (Ju and Wei, 2006;
  Caballero, Farhi and Gouinchas, 2008; Mendoza, Quadrini and
  Rios-Rull, 2009)
\item Differences in factor utilization (Jin, 2012)
\item Differences in contracting frictions (Aguiar and Amador, 2010)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Unsorted}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[-] Implications for equilibrium portfolios and global imbalances
\item Gourinchas and Rey (2007)
\item Govillot, Rey and Gourinchas (2010)
\item[-] Global financial cycles
\item Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2020)
\item[-] Debt crises
